# Day-Planner

This is part of the Rutgers-Coding-Boot-Camp -FSF-Fullstack program

WEEK05-THIRD-PARTY-API'S/02-HOMEWORK

This is a simple application that allows you to create a schedule for the day.
1. Each time slot is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present or future

2. click into a time slot to enter an event

3. click the save button for that time slot the text for that event is saved in local storage
4. WHEN I refresh the page the saved events persist
