# Day-Planner
This is part of the Rutgers-Coding-Boot-Camp -FSF-fullstack program
WEEK05-THIRD-PARTY-API'S/02-HOMEWORK


This is a simple application that allows you to create a schedule for the day.
Each time slot is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present or future

WHEN I click into a time slot
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time slot
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
